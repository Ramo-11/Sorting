Sorting Project

Instruction to run the program:

You can run the program in VSCode, go to a command line and type "make clean" -> "make" -> "./main.exe" without the quotoes. 
However, you must have g++ and make installed. 

You can download the repo directly from github: https://github.com/Ramo-11/Sorting.git
And then you can run it on Tesla. Again by typing "make clean" -> "make" -> "./main.exe" without the quotoes

Or you can just copy the code from Sort.h, Sort.cpp, and main.cpp, and run it however you want.
